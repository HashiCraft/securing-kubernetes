We have set up a hacking environment for you on your local machine.
The environment is built on Kali Linux and contains most of the tools you will need for this exercise.

You can start using it by exec-ing into the kali container.

```shell
$ shipyard exec container.kali -- bash

â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/]
â””â”€$
```
